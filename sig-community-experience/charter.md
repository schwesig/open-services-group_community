# SIG Community Experience Charter
This charter adheres to the conventions described in the [Charter README] and uses
the Roles and Organization Management outlined in [sig-governance].
## Scope

The goal of this SIG is to reach and maintain a high quality of our services.
Quality is so far defined as in the easy sentence "what helps the community and the user to solve a problem".
Services needs to be understandable, easy to use, recreatable and doing a good job.
High quality therefore can be defined by (not necessarly a complete or static list):

- easy to understand (know what you get before trying)
- easy to use (worth a try)
- easy to repeat (lowering the hurdle for using it again)
- solving a problem (knowing the problem)
- solving it good (knowing the community/customer)
- solving it fast (optimized, automated, workflow)
...

Following Open Source and believing in the Upstream, community is the key; as user and as contributor.
These sentence seems obvious and maybe shallow, but according to documents like "Why Open Source our Managed Services?", ["Why “Operate first” is important for your project](https://www.opensourcerers.org/2021/08/30/why-operate-first-is-important-for-your-project/), [Your Service is not Open Source](http://stef.thewalter.net/open-source-services.html), and others.
Basically it says: Leverage our Open Source heritage, don't forget our Open Source Heritage. This SIG should take care and have an eye on this.

- Building Community and understanding problems
- Communication (with the Community) helps to find the needs or solve the problems.
- Marketing helps to understand the service and create a bigger Community.
- Metrics and Measurements (maybe SLO and SLI) help to do the right things and doing things right, but also fast(er).
- Governance & OrgOps help to streamline, workflow, reproduce, and bring the right people and skills to the right topics.

#### Statement

### In scope
- Community, Communication, Marketing
- Metrics, Measurements
- Governance, OrgOps
- Data Driven "All"
- Quality of issues, PRs, documentation, published material, charters, etc.

**Community**: Focus on our community in a wider meaning as mainly External (Upstream) Community, Contributors, but also our internal/external partners and Red Hat Teams, Projects and Services, that we can and need to support and to engage. Enable, Scale and Speed the Community.
- Thoughts need only to be thought once.
- New things should only be tried once.
- Mistakes must only be made once.

After that, it should be learned and documented knowledge, to be build on.

**Communication**: Maintain and create a vivid exchange of ideas, needs and knowlegde between all areas and people that we define in the word Community before. Knowledge and Experience once made must be availabe to everybody in a high quality way to make it easy to find, easy to understand and esasy to reproduce. The goal is to always have the newest foundation (of knowledge) to build on, instead of always inventing the wheel again. Build upon knowlege, avoid traps, and feel safe by having guidelines.

**Marketing**: Let the world (Communities and beyond) know, what we are doing. But also let us know (market research), what the world is doing. What needs to be done or is our community maybe changing and has other needs or people. Communication can solve a few of these things too, but Marketing reaches out more far and includes topics that are (yet) out of our sight.

**Metrics & Measurements**: Define and find, based on Community, Communication and Marketing, what are the right targets to aim at. What is quality or speed for our community? And what are the biggest drivers to measure or archieve these targets? And how can we measure this? Finding and defining the right KPIs, watch them, and present them in a helping way.

**Governance**: Defining, Updating and Coaching the guidelins for a good community. Find and define the best ways and methods to work together, decide together and protect ideas and teams.

**OrgOps**: Easy said as: bringing the Governance into action. "Performance of a practical work or of something involving the practical application of principles or processes. Practice until you can go through the whole operation without hesitation or thinking." By principals we can use the Governance, practical work as will be the organization.

**Data Driven "All"**: Coming from data driven development, why stop at that. Use data to drive everything that can be measured and find ways to measure things, that can not be measured yet. Establishing or proving the idea, that a thought only needs to be thought once, and a mistake should only be made ones, after that it should be knowledge that can be applied instead of trying again, data driven can help e.g. to find where things were done twice or more and work on the why and solve it.
